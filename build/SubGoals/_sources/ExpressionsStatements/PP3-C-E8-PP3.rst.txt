    E1 - Evaluate an assignment statement
    1.	Determine whether data type of expression is compatible with data type of variable
    2.	Update variable for pre based on side effect
    3.	Solve arithmetic equation
    4.	Check data type of copied value against data type of variable
    5.	Update variable for post based on side effect


**Assume the following given declarations:**

.. code-block:: cpp

    int alpha = 2, beta = 1, delta = 3, eta, gamma;
    double omega = 2.5, theta = -1.3, kappa = 3.0, lambda, rho; 


Evaluate this statement. If invalid, give the reason. If valid, what value is assigned to the variable? Note any possible side effects. Each statement below is evaluated individually - i.e., they all begin with the values above.

.. code-block:: cpp

    gamma = alpha + ++beta / delta--;
